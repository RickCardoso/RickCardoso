### Who Am I

I'm a software engineer who loves knowing the business and the clients' pains. I enjoy thinking about the user experience from beggining to end. You could say I'm a product-minded engineer or a UX engineer.

I'll question the purpose of the code, the reasons why we're choosing some strategy. Good code is clean code, but good products solve problems.

### What Else

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Stone Co. as a Product Manager
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on personal projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really, I'm not the type to beat around the bushes
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a young (31 yo) father of a 5 year old girl, a 10 year old male dog and a 8 year old female dog (as of 2020)
